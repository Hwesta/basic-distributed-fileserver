=== CMPT431 Assignment 2 ===
=== A Distributed File System with Transactional Semantics ===
=== By Holly Becker ===

Language: Python
Libraries: Twisted

If the client sends multiple writes to the same transation with the same message sequence number, the old write will be replaced by the new write.
If the client commits with few writes than it gave (eg. commit saying 4 write, but sent 5 messages), the higher numbered writes will be ignored.
The server never forgets transactions.
